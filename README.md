=========

A simple CI machine built in Node. Super lightweight.

Supports remote push hooks, from GitHub, BitBucket and the like.

Think of it like Jenkins on diet.

The main functionality I wanted was multiple public and private jobs, artifacting, SQLite based, custom scripts for building and git support. Anything else probably won't happen.
